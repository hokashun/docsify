# Concepts

This documentation is intended to guide you for the extended development of GR-1 based on the SDKs provided.

Two approaches are provided to control and develop the GR-1 robot:

* Through virtual environment Webots
* Through physical robot

For the development using virtual environment, refer to [Extended Development Through Virtual Environment Webots](#extended-development-through-virtual-environment-webots).

For the development using physical robot, refer to [Extended Development Through Physical GR-1 Robot](#extended-development-through-physical-gr-1-robot).

# Fourier GR-1

Fourier GR-1 is a general-purpose humanoid robot. It is composed of up to 40 FSA joints, which can provide 230 N.m peak joint torque. The whole body controll algorithm enables 44 full-body degrees of freedom.

Its human-like agility and motion kinematics, such as:

* Straight leg walking
* Fast walking
* Agile obstacle evasion
* Steady slope ascending and descending
* Resilient impact disturbance response
* Human-robot collaboration in task execution

makes it a potential carrier for the next-generation "Embodied AI", which would combine AI technology with physical robots to provide controllable, perceptible, interactive, and mobile entities.

The Fourier GR-1 offers scalability for validating various AI models and algorithms, with significant potential in industrial, rehabilitation, home, and research applications.

## Operation Instruction

#### Before power-on

Do the following steps before powering on the robot:

1. Inspect robot.
   Confirm that the robot is fastened to the support stand.
   Confirm that the batteries of robot and the support stand are fully chareged.
   Confirm that the robot components moves smoothly.

   ![1698657344119](image/README/1698657344119.png)
2. Inspect environment.
   Confirm that a 4 m clearance in the vicinity of the robot and the ground is level and dry.

   ![1698656074242](image/README/1698656074242.png)
3. Connect robot to monitor.
   Power on the router.
   Connect monitor with Type-C interface through the extension dock.

   ![1698657743472](image/README/1698657743472.png)
4. Prepare arms ready for calibration.
   Align shoulder grooves.
   Keep arms straight downards and palms inwards-facing.
   Ensure a 10 cm interval between palms and hips.
   Keep the robot stand up straight.

   ![1698658681237](image/README/1698658681237.png)

### Powering on Robot

1. Press actuator power-on button.
2. Press robot host power-on button.
3. Release e-stop switch.

   ![1698659185945](image/README/1698659185945.png)
4. Initialize robot arms and legs through desktop terminal.
   Enter the following command to calibrate arms.

   ```
   $sh arm .sh
   ```

   Enter the following command to calibrate legs.

   ```
   $sh leg.sh
   ```
5. The robot is started successfullly if the indicator lights of actuators and robot host flash regularly.

   ![1698661268810](image/README/1698661268810.png)

### Connecting Remote Controller to Robot

1. Switch on the remote controller and open the System Settings interface.
2. Input the Wi-Fi account and password specified on the back of the robot.

![1698736555432](image/README/1698736555432.png)

1. Click **Connect** .
   A successful prompt will be given if when the connection succeeds.

### Landing Robot

1. Ensure that the robot is fastened to the support stand.
2. Click **Initial** to make the robot to initial state.
   ![1698744141867](image/README/1698744141867.png)
3. Lower the robot with the lift of the support stand.
   Make sure the robot's feet stably contact with the ground.
4. Click **Stand** in the remote controller.

![1698744210172](image/README/1698744210172.png)

### Controlling Robot

1. Power on the remote controller and connect to the robot's Wi-Fi.
2. Operate the remote controller to control the motion of the robot.
   Use left handler to move the robot. Use right handler to control the vision field.

   ![1698744913325](image/README/1698744913325.png)

### Pausing Robot Motion

Following two approaches are used to pause the motion of the robot:

* Press the **Stand** button on the remote controller.
* Press down the E-stop in case of danger or any emergency situation.
  This would cut off the power supply of the robot and risk of data loss.

### Powering off Robot

1. Fasten the robot to the supoort stand.
2. Press the E-stop button.
3. Press the actuator power button to power off the actuator.
4. Connect the robot to the monitor.
5. Kill the processes of the control software and then power off the robot host through the desktop terminal.

## About Robot Control System (RoCS)

In general, our softwares are divided into two parts: the upper computer and the lower computer.

* The lower computer is like the cerebellum in humans, mainly responsible for motion control related tasks such as motor driving, motion algorithms, hardware drivers, etc.
* The upper computer mainly focuses on data transmission and a small amount of logic applications. For example, receiving and playing sound, video stream transmission, sending instructions, receiving status, etc.

The **Robot Control System** is responsible for the overall monitoring and remote control functions of the robot. It is divided into three layers:
**Control App** (user graphic application), **Client SDK** (client interface), **Server API** (server interface).

* **Server API** runs on the robot and is a thin data forwarding layer. It uses `http` and `websocket` protocols to forward external commands to the lower computer and various data from the robot to the outside. Although it runs inside the robot, this layer is also part of the upper computer. It is the interface between the lower computer and the outside world. Because this time it is just a forwarding layer, and considering efficiency and other users' security, it has not been open-sourced.
* **Client SDK** can use any tool (as long as it supports `http` and `websocket` protocols) to access the **Server API**. But for developers' convenience, we provide the **Client SDK**, which encapsulates the **Server API**, providing a more friendly interface. Developers can directly use the corresponding language's **Client SDK** to develop their own applications. This layer is open-source.
* **Control App** runs on terminals outside of the robot body (computers or mobile phones) and is a user graphic application. The purpose of the **Control App** is not to provide a complete consumer-oriented application, but to make all functions into a comprehensive example for developers' reference. Developers can refer to the code of the **Control App** to develop their own applications. This layer is also open-source.

All upper computer software together is called `RoCS`, which stands for:
**Ro**bot **C**ontrol **S**ystem
